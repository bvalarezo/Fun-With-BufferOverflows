## Fun with BufferOverflows

In this assignment you will write exploits for some trivial vulnerable
programs. The goal of all exploits is to launch a shell as root. Each script
should prepare the appropriate malicious input and launch the vulnerable
program with it to get a shell. The exploits should be launched from a
non-root shell. You can use any language you prefer for the exploit scripts.
